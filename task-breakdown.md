PCAP to Mermaid Diagram Steps:
1. Command-line Interface:
• Define and parse command-line arguments (e.g., path to the pcap file, optional filters, output file options).
2. PCAP Parsing:
• Load the provided pcap file using a library (or an external tool like tshark/pyshark) to extract packets.
• Filter out only the packets relevant to SIP calls.
3. Extracting SIP Data:
• From the SIP packets, extract key information such as timestamps, call IDs, SIP methods (INVITE, ACK, BYE, etc.), senders, and receivers.
• Convert those extracted details into a structured format (e.g., a Python object or a JSON-like structure).
4. Grouping by Call:
• Organize the SIP messages by Call-ID so that each group represents a single call session.
• Sort each group by the timestamp to reconstruct the call flow chronologically.
5. Building the Call Flow:
• For each call, determine the sequence of interactions.
• Identify the participants (e.g., caller, callee, proxy) based on the SIP headers.
6. Generating a Mermaid Diagram:
• Use the Mermaid sequence diagram syntax (e.g., starting with “sequenceDiagram”) to map out each SIP interaction.
• Convert the sequential SIP messages into corresponding diagram statements (e.g., “A->>B: INVITE”, “B-->>A: 200 OK”), ensuring that the order is preserved.
• Accumulate all these interactions into a complete Mermaid diagram script.
7. Output the Diagram:
• Print the Mermaid diagram to stdout or write it to a file.
• Optionally, provide instructions on how to visualize the diagram using Mermaid live editors or integrations.
8. Testing & Validation:
• Run the tool with test pcap samples to ensure that the output diagram accurately represents the SIP call flows.
• Validate that edge cases (e.g., missing SIP messages or out-of-order messages) are handled gracefully.
